# Run16 VPD Plan B  
<br>

### Common Mode Jitter found on individual QT cards  
The $$\sigma$$( tac1 - tac2 ) for channels on the same daughter card ( black points ) and channels on different daughter cards ( red points ).   
This shows a clear correlation between tacs on individual daughter cards.

### Current Performance  
* Current Method : Use earliest TAC on the east and west to calculate vertex.
* The earliest TAC method is ~25 - 35% better than using the later TACs. See : [Earliest TAC method](http://www4.rcf.bnl.gov/~jdb/tofCalibration/Run16/AuAu200/VPD_Trigger/Fastest%20TAC%20vs%20others.html)  
<br>

### Run14 : Average TAC method
* Shuai and Qian showed that in Run14 using the mean TAC on east and west instead of the earliest gives improved performance. See :
